# Yahoo-Finance-Stock-Scraper
This project is a web scraper designed to collect data on companies listed on Nasdaq. The scraper uses Selenium to navigate and extract company names from the Nasdaq screener. The second part of the project leverages the yfinance library to fetch detailed financial information about these companies, including logos, stock prices, and dividend data.
